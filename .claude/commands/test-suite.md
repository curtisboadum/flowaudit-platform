# Test Suite

Run tests, check coverage, and write missing tests.

## Steps

1. Run the full test suite: `pnpm test`
2. Check coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
3. Identify files in `src/lib/` below 80% coverage.
4. For each uncovered file, write missing tests following the patterns in the `testing` skill.
5. Re-run tests to verify new tests pass.
6. Report final coverage numbers.
